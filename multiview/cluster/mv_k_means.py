class MultiviewKMeans(BaseCluster):

    '''
    An implementation of Multi-View K-Means using the co-EM algorithm.
    This algorithm currently handles two views of data.

    Paramters
    ---------
    k : int
        The number of clusters

    random_state : int (default=None)
        Determines random number generation for initializing centroids.
        Can seed the random number generator with an int.

    Attributes
    ----------

    _k : int
        The number of clusters

    _random_state : int
        The seed for the random number generator used during centroid
        initialization.

    _centroids : list of array_likes
        - _centroids shape: (2,)
        - _centroids[0] shape: (n_clusters, n_features_i)
        The cluster centroids for each of the two views. _centroids[0]
        corresponds to the centroids of view 1 and _centroids[1] corresponds
        to the centroids of view 2.
