    """
    Random Subspace Method for constructing multiple views.
    Each view is constructed by randomly selecting n_features
    (columns) from X. All unselected features are set to 0.

    Original paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/709601

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like matrix, shape = [n_rows, n_cols]
        The input samples.

    n_features : int, float
        Number of features to randomly select.

        - If int, then consider n_features as number of columns
        to select.

        - If float, then consider n_features*n_cols as number of columns
        to select.

    n_views : int, float optional (default = 1)
        Number of views to construct.

    Returns
    -------
    views : list of array-like matrices
        List of constructed views (each matrix has shape [n_rows, n_cols]).
