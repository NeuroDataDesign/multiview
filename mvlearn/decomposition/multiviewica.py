class MultiviewICA(BaseICA):
    r"""
    Multiview ICA for which views share a common source but separate mixing
    matrices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_components : int, optional
        Number of components to extract. If None, n_components is set to
        the minimum number of features in the dataset.

    noise : float, default=1.0
        Gaussian noise level

    max_iter : int, default=1000
        Maximum number of iterations to perform

    init : {'permica', 'groupica'} or np array of shape
        (n_groups, n_components, n_components), default='permica'
        If permica: initialize with perm ICA, if groupica, initialize with
        group ica. Else, use the provided array to initialize.

    preproc: 'pca' or a ViewTransformer-like instance,
        default='pca'
        Preprocessing method to use to reduce data.
        If "pca", performs PCA separately on each view to reduce dimension
        of each view.
        Otherwise the dimension reduction is performed using the transform
        method of the ViewTransformer-like object. This instance also needs
        an inverse transform method to recover original data from reduced data.

    multiview_output : bool, optional (default True)
        If True, the `.transform` method returns one dataset per view.
        Otherwise, it returns one dataset, of shape (n_samples, n_components)

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Used to perform a random initialization. If int, random_state is
        the seed used by the random number generator; If RandomState
        instance, random_state is the random number generator; If
        None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance
        used by np.random.

    tol : float, default=1e-3
        A positive scalar giving the tolerance at which
        the un-mixing matrices are considered to have converged.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Print information

    Attributes
    ----------
    preproc : ViewTransformer-like instance
        The fitted instance used for preprocessing
    W_list : np array of shape (n_groups, n_components, n_components)
        The unmixing matrices to apply on preprocessed data

    See also
    --------
    groupica
    permica

    Notes
    -----
    Given each view :math:`X_i` It optimizes:

        .. math::
            l(W) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T [\sum_k log(cosh(Y_{avg,k,t}))
            + \sum_i l_i(X_{i,.,t})]

    where

        .. math::
            l _i(X_{i,.,t}) = - log(|W_i|) + 1/(2 \sigma) ||X_{i,.,t}W_i -
            Y_{avg,.,t}||^2,

    :math:`W_i` is the mixing matrix for view  :math:`i`,
    :math:`Y_{avg} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i W_i`, and :math:`\sigma`
    is the noise level.
