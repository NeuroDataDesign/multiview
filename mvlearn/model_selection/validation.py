def cross_validate(estimator, Xs, y, *args, **kwargs):
    r"""Evaluate metric(s) by cross-validation and also record fit/score times.
    Works on multiview data, by wrapping
    `sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator : estimator object implementing 'fit'
        The object to use to fit the data.


    Xs_transformed : list of array-likes
        - Xs shape: (n_views,)
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
        The multiview data to fit

    y : array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs), \
            default=None
        The target variable to try to predict in the case of
        supervised learning.

    args : any
        Additional arguments passed to `sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate`

    kwargs : any
        Additional named arguments to `sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate`
