    r"""
    Plots each dimension fron one view against each dimension from a second
    view. If both views are the same, this reduces to a pairplot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Xs : list of array-likes or numpy.ndarray
        - Xs length: n_views
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features_i)
        The two views to plot against one another. If one view has fewer
        dimensions than the other, only that many will be plotted.
    labels : boolean, default=None
        Sets the labels of the samples.
    dimensions : array-like of ints, default=None
        The dimensions of the views to plot. If `None`, all dimensions up
        to the minimum between the views will be plotted.
    figsize : tuple, default=(10,10)
        Sets the grid figure size.
    title : string, default=None
        Sets the title of the grid.
    show : boolean, default=True
        Shows the plots if true. Returns the objects otherwise.
    context : one of {'paper', 'notebook', 'talk', 'poster, None},
        default='notebook'
        Sets the seaborn plotting context.
    equal_axes : boolean, default=False
        Equalizes the axes of the plots on the diagonals if true.
    ax_ticks : boolean, default=True
        Whether to have tick marks on the axes.
    ax_labels : boolean, default=True
        Whether to label the axes with the view and dimension numbers.
    scatter_kwargs : dict, default={}
        Additional matplotlib.pyplot.scatter arguments.
    fig_kwargs : dict, default={}
        Additional matplotlib.pyplot.subplots arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    (fig, axes) : tuple of the figure and its axes.
        Only returned if `show=False`.
