Embedding
=========
Inference on and visualization of multiview data often requires low-dimensional representations of the data, known as *embeddings*. Below are tutorials for computing such embeddings on multiview data.

Plotting
========
Methods build on top of Matplotlib and Seaborn have been implemented for convenient plotting of multiview data. See examples of such plots on simulated data.

Test Dataset
============
In order to conviently run tools in this package on multview data, data can be simulated or  be accessed from the publicly available `UCI multiple features dataset <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Multiple+Features>`_ using a dataloader in this package.
