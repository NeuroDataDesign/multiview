Changelog
=========

Version 0.2.0
-------------
Updates in this release:

- ``MVMDS`` can not also accept distance matrices as input, rather than only views of data with samples and features
- A new clustering algorithm, ``CoRegMultiviewSpectralClustering`` - co-regularized multi-view spectral clustering functionality
- Some attribute names slightly changed for more intuitive use in ``DCCA``, ``KCCA``, ``MVMDS``, ``CTClassifier``
- Option to use an Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition method for ``KCCA`` to reduce up computation times
- A new module, ``factorization``, containing the ``AJIVE`` algorithm - angle-based joint and individual variance explained
- Fixed issue where signal dimensions of noise were dependent in the GaussianMixtures class
- Added a dependecy to ``joblib`` to enable parallel clustering implementation
- Removed the requirements for ``torchvision`` and ``pillow``, since they are only used in tutorials


Version 0.1.0
-------------

We’re happy to announce the first major stable version of ``mvlearn``.
This version includes multiple new algorithms, more utility functions, as well as significant enhancements to the documentation. Here are some highlights of the big updates.

- Deep CCA, (``DCCA``) in the ``embed`` module
- Updated ``KCCA`` with multiple kernels
- Synthetic multi-view dataset generator class, ``GaussianMixture``, in the ``datasets`` module
- A new module, ``plotting``, which includes functions for visualizing multi-view data, such as ``crossviews_plot`` and ``quick_visualize``
- More detailed tutorial notebooks for all algorithms

Additionally, mvlearn now makes the ``torch`` and ``tqdm`` dependencies optional, so users who don’t need the DCCA or SplitAE functionality do not have to import such a large package. **Note** this is only the case for installing with pip. Installing from ``conda`` includes these dependencies automatically. To install the full version of mvlearn with ``torch`` and ``tqdm`` from pip, you must include the optional torch in brackets:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        pip3 install mvlearn[torch]

or

    .. code-block:: python
        
        pip3 install --upgrade mvlearn[torch]


To install **without** ``torch``, do:

    .. code-block:: python
        
        pip3 install mvlearn

or

    .. code-block:: python
        
        pip3 install --upgrade mvlearn
