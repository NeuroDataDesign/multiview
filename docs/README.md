# Building Docs

The online documentation is created using Spinx and hosted using Netlify.

## Generating the documentation

To build the HTML documentation, first install requirements from the `requirements.txt` file and enter:

    make html

in the `doc/` directory. This will generate a `_build/html/` subdirectory containing the built documentation.
